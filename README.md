A little about why this application.
It seems to me that the people who love us are usually more interested in our wellbeing then we are. I know I put more energy into the wellness of my wife, and when she could. she put a lot into mine.
its not that personal wellness isn't important to me, just that it always seemed selfish to spend time like that on me when there is always so much needing to be done to increase quality of life for those I love.
so i started to make this, but instead of me entering my info and creating my schedules to take care of myself, why not allow someone who has the motivation to do so create it with you and I with them.
Adding doctor recommendations, appointments, special meal requirements, considering spiritual, mental and physical wellness in one place, where the development of the data and adherence to the program you set, is shared with
those closest to you.
Fringe benefit that I began to discover is that just in using something like that. The time spent in such close space with a partner, family member, will realize mental, emotional and spiritual benefits all by itself.
